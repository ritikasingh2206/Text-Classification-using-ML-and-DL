# Text-Classification-using-ML-and-DL
This project implements text classification using both traditional machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) approaches. It includes Multinomial Naive Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbors classifiers for ML, and a sequential neural network model with embedding and dense layers for DL using TensorFlow and Keras. The dataset used is the 20 newsgroups dataset, and evaluation metrics such as accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix are utilized. Results show the effectiveness of both ML and DL in accurately classifying text data, with DL demonstrating superior performance in certain categories.
